				<p><em>london. summer 2005.</em></p>				
				<p> i have been pretty fortunate in my post-college years to have travelled extensively across the us and to different countries. the idea of travel and its implementation (after i made some
					cash) have always an important part of my life. travel forces me to reflect on my culture, privilege, morals, really anything that is subjective and open to evaluation. 
					so given that, my very first trip outside of the us holds a very special place in my heart. the summer of freshman year i went to london with a friend. we were relatively poor 
					college students and stayed with an aunt of mine in the suburbs of london. we visited all the usual tourist spots: big ben, the tower of london, the london eye, tate modern but what i
					love most was roaming the streets on my own and getting lost in the small alleyways, among buildings that were likely hundreds of years older than anything i had seen in the states. 
					because we were over 18, we felt like grown ups drinking in pubs with londoners after work let out. we took a day trip to oxford; what an absolutely incredible city with brilliant people and 
					gorgeous architecture - to this day i hope to somehow attend that school. <a href="#">more pictures.</a> </p> <br>

				<p><em>paris. fall 2008.</em></p>
				<p> through high school and college, it was always my dream destination. i took french for 4 years and became a little obsessed with the history and culture. when i finally got a chance 
					to go, the city lived up to all of my expectations. everything in paris is beautiful. the notre dame, the seine, the louvre, everything looks like it belongs in a movie (midnight in paris
					maybe?). it's only when you travel to the suburbs you realize that paris is complicated. before i left for my trip i had a chance to read "the discovery of france" by robb graham which tells the
					story of how the country of france was actually formed by very diverse regions. france just a hundred years ago would be unrecognizable today. i've been back to paris more recently and been able to 
					go into the countryside. i visited the castles of the loire valley and stayed in tours. i also visited giverny and toured monet's gardens. i sincerely hope i can one day brush up on my french and 
					experience paris and france as a local. <a href="#">more pictures.</a> </p> <br>

				<img src="img/turkey.jpg" class="img-circle">
				<p><em>istanbul. fall 2013.</em></p>
				<p> istanbul was my first trip to a major city not in western europe (aside from family vacations to india). growing up in the american school system a majority of the history we learn is western history. we 
					become very familiar with the places and customs in western europe and america. those become the places you want to travel to and experience first hand. also because i was born in india and grew up in the
					culture, asian culture (as diverse as it is) didn't appeal to me. i felt guilty at times that i was bascially neglecting more than half of the world in my travels. a good friend of mine convinced me to go to 
					turkey as a stepping stone to the rest of asia. istanbul was absolutely incredible and is currently my favorite that i've visited. the islamic and christian hertiage of the country yields mind blowing architecture
					like the hagia sophia, blue mosque, and topkapi palace. the food is wonderful and the atmosphere is a good blend of east and west (a bit chaotic but not the panicked stress i feel in india). i usually hate it when people
					characterize an entire population of a country as "friendly" because it sounds patronizing and discounts the sociopolitical reasons people might behave that way towards you. but i did feel that in general the 
					people in istanbul were warmer than other places i've been. <a href="#">more pictures.</a> </p> <br>
